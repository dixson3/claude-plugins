# Chronicler Diary Skill

Generate consolidated diary entries from open chronicle beads.

## Instructions

Use the `chronicler_diary` agent to:
1. Query all open chronicle beads
2. Group beads by theme/topic
3. Generate diary markdown files
4. Close the processed beads

## Behavior

When invoked with `/chronicler:diary`:

1. **Query beads**: List all open beads with `ys:chronicle` label
2. **Launch agent**: Use the `chronicler_diary` agent to process
3. **Generate files**: Create diary entries in `docs/diary/`
4. **Close beads**: Mark processed beads as closed

### Agent Invocation

The diary agent:
- Reads all open chronicle beads
- Groups by theme (may combine related topics)
- Generates markdown diary entries
- Returns JSON with filenames and content

### Diary Entry Format

Filename: `docs/diary/YY-MM-DD.HH-MM.<topic>.md`

```markdown
# Diary Entry: <Title>

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Topics**: feature, planning
**Chronicle IDs**: abc123, def456

## Expected Output

```
Generating diary entries...

Processing 3 open chronicle beads...

Grouping by theme:
- Authentication work: abc123, def456
- Memory investigation: ghi789

Generating diary entries:

[1] docs/diary/26-02-04.14-30.authentication.md
    - Title: User Authentication Implementation
    - Chronicles: abc123, def456
    - Created successfully

[2] docs/diary/26-02-04.14-30.debugging.md
    - Title: Memory Leak Investigation
    - Chronicles: ghi789
    - Created successfully

Closing processed beads...
- abc123: closed
- def456: closed
- ghi789: closed

Diary generation complete!
2 diary entries created from 3 chronicles.
```

## Pre-Push Integration

The diary skill is designed to run before git push:

1. Pre-push hook detects open chronicles
2. Signals to run `/chronicler:diary`
3. Diary entries are staged with the push
4. Chronicles are closed

## No Open Chronicles

If no open chronicles exist:

```
Generating diary entries...

No open chronicle beads found.
Nothing to add to diary.
```

## Diary Directory

Diary entries are written to `docs/diary/`. Create this directory with `/chronicler:init` or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/diary
```
