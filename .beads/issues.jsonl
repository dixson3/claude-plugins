{"id":"marketplace-0rt","title":"Plan 15: Split yf.json into committable config + local overrides — completed","description":"## Summary\n\nImplemented Plan 15: splitting the single gitignored .claude/yf.json into two files — a committable shared config (yf.json v2) and a gitignored local overrides file (yf.local.json). This enables team-shareable configuration while keeping machine-local preflight state out of git.\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n- **Merge semantics**: jq recursive merge (`.[0] * .[1]`) — local keys always win. Simple, predictable, no special casing needed.\n- **Config library approach**: Created `yf-config.sh` as a sourceable shell library rather than a standalone script. All hooks source it with 3 lines replacing 4-line inline jq guards. This centralizes the two-file merge logic.\n- **Migration chain**: Preserved full backward compat: plugin-lock.json (v0) → yf.json v1 (all-in-one) → yf.json v2 + yf.local.json. Each migration step is idempotent.\n- **Boolean null-check pattern**: Kept `if .field == null then true else .field end` in the library to avoid the jq `//` pitfall with `false` values.\n- **Setup wizard Q4**: Added \"commit to git?\" question. \"Yes\" writes config to yf.json and strips overrides from local. \"No\" ensures minimal yf.json (`{version:2}`) and puts config in local.\n\n## Files Changed\n\n### New (3)\n- plugins/yf/scripts/yf-config.sh — shared config library (5 functions)\n- tests/scenarios/unit-yf-config-merge.yaml — 8 merge semantics tests\n- tests/scenarios/unit-yf-v2-migration.yaml — 7 v1→v2 migration tests\n\n### Modified (14)\n- 4 hooks: replaced inline guards with library sourcing\n- plugin-preflight.sh: major rewrite for two-file model\n- SKILL.md (setup): Q4 + two-file write logic\n- .gitignore: yf.json now committable\n- plugin.json: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0\n- CLAUDE.md: documented two-file model\n- CHANGELOG.md: [2.2.0] entry\n- 6 existing test scenarios updated\n\n## Results\n\n221 unit tests pass (0 failures). All existing behavior preserved. New tests cover merge semantics, local overrides, malformed files, and full migration chain.\n\n## Note\n\nThis was implemented without the beads lifecycle (no auto-chain fired because the plan was provided inline, not via ExitPlanMode).

{"id":"marketplace-1va","title":"Plan 27: Beads Git Workflow Integration — planning and implementation","description":"## Summary\n\nImplemented Plan 27: Beads Git Workflow Integration (v2.12.0). This reverses the local-only beads decision from v2.5.0 (Plan 18), transitioning .beads/ to git-tracked with a beads-sync branch strategy.\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n- **beads-sync branch strategy**: Beads data lives on a dedicated sync branch, keeping code branches clean. Git hooks handle JSONL export/import automatically.\n- **Beads manages its own .gitignore**: Rather than the project-level .gitignore ignoring .beads/, beads now manages .beads/.gitignore internally (tracking issues.jsonl, config.yaml, metadata.json; ignoring *.db, daemon files).\n- **Pre-push hook auto-pushes beads-sync**: A custom pre-push hook (installed by install-beads-push-hook.sh) compares local vs remote refs and pushes beads-sync alongside whatever branch the user is pushing. Fail-open design.\n- **Migration is automatic**: plugin-preflight.sh detects legacy local-only deployments (by checking if .beads/ appears in the yf-managed gitignore block) and migrates them: configures sync branch, enables mass-delete protection, installs hooks, runs bd doctor.\n- **bd init no longer uses --skip-hooks**: The preflight setup command chains bd init → sync branch config → mass-delete protection → bd hooks install.\n\n## Current State\n\n- All 5 phases complete, all beads closed\n- 424 unit tests passing, 0 failures\n- 11 files changed (2 new, 1 deleted, 8 modified)\n- Version bumped to 2.12.0 with full changelog entry\n\n## Files Changed\n\n- plugins/yf/scripts/setup-project.sh — removed .beads/ from managed block\n- plugins/yf/scripts/install-beads-push-hook.sh — new pre-push hook installer\n- plugins/yf/.claude-plugin/preflight.json — updated beads setup command\n- plugins/yf/scripts/plugin-preflight.sh — added migration + hook installer\n- plugins/yf/rules/beads.md — rewritten for git-tracked model\n- plugins/yf/README.md — updated beads note\n- plugins/yf/DEVELOPERS.md — updated managed block + rationale\n- tests/scenarios/unit-beads-git.yaml — new (9 cases)\n- tests/scenarios/unit-beads-local.yaml — deleted\n- tests/scenarios/unit-setup-project.yaml — updated\n- CHANGELOG.md, plugin.json, CLAUDE.md — version bump\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Code changes not yet committed or pushed\n- User should run git add/commit/push when ready","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T17:02:23.832015-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-13T17:02:23.832015-08:00","labels":["plan:27","ys:chronicle","ys:topic:planning"]}

This keeps plugin.json clean for Claude Code's validator while preserving the full preflight artifact sync engine.\n- **Naming**: Used `preflight.json` (consistent with existing naming: preflight system, preflight-wrapper.sh)\n\n### Changes Made\n- Created `plugins/workflows/.claude-plugin/preflight.json` (dependencies + artifacts)\n- Created `plugins/chronicler/.claude-plugin/preflight.json` (dependencies + artifacts)\n- Stripped `dependencies` and `artifacts` from both `plugin.json` files\n- Updated `scripts/plugin-preflight.sh` to read from `preflight.json` (version still from `plugin.json`)\n- Updated 3 test scenarios to check `preflight.json`\n- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation and MEMORY.md\n\n### Root Cause\nClaude Code plugin validator uses strict JSON schema — any unrecognized top-level keys cause: `Validation errors: : Unrecognized keys: \"dependencies\", \"artifacts\"`\n\n### Related\n- scripts/plugin-preflight.sh\n- plugins/workflows/.claude-plugin/plugin.json\n- plugins/workflows/.claude-plugin/preflight.json\n- plugins/chronicler/.claude-plugin/plugin.json\n- plugins/chronicler/.claude-plugin/preflight.json\n- tests/scenarios/unit-chronicler-init.yaml\n- tests/scenarios/unit-plan-intake.yaml\n- CLAUDE.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T11:45:14.522395-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T11:45:42.604085-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T11:45:42.604085-08:00","close_reason":"Processed into diary entry","labels":["ys:chronicle","ys:topic:bugfix"]}

{"id":"marketplace-4ba","title":"Plan 08 design: auto-chain exit-plan-mode lifecycle","description":"## Summary\n\nDesigned Plan 08 to simplify the exit-plan-mode workflow from 4 manual steps to a single ExitPlanMode action that auto-chains the full lifecycle.\n\n## Decisions\n\n1. **Option C selected**: Keep internal states (Draft/Ready/Executing) but auto-chain transitions. User just exits plan mode; system does save → beads → execute automatically. States remain for Pause/Resume/Complete.\n\n2. **Auto-chain mechanism**: Hook output + Rule. The `exit-plan-gate.sh` hook (deterministic shell) saves the plan and outputs an \"Auto-chaining\" signal. A new `auto-chain-plan.md` rule (behavioral, read by Claude) drives the chain: format plan → MEMORY update → plan_to_beads → plan-exec.sh start → execute_plan. Hooks can't invoke skills, so the rule bridges that gap.\n\n3. **Plugin dependency boundaries**: workflows MUST NOT depend on chronicler. chronicler CAN depend on workflows and roles. The chronicle capture reminder comes from a new chronicler rule (`plan-transition-chronicle.md`), not from workflows. If chronicler isn't installed, auto-chain runs without capture. Clean composability.\n\n4. **engage_plan simplification**: Draft transition becomes legacy/fallback (still works if user explicitly says \"engage the plan\"). Engage_plan retains Pause/Resume/Complete. The \"engage the plan\" trigger phrases removed from the happy path rule.\n\n5. **Gate timing**: The .plan-gate stays active during auto-chain. All auto-chain operations use Bash (bd commands) or gate-exempt paths (docs/plans/). Gate is removed at the end by plan-exec.sh start.\n\n6. **Chronicle positioning**: Chronicler rule fires between plan save and beads creation — natural insertion point. Captures design rationale, alternatives, trade-offs from planning discussion before they're lost to compaction.\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Option A** (collapse into fewer steps): Rejected — loses the ability to pause/resume mid-execution.\n- **Option B** (single command does everything): Rejected — too monolithic, no composability with chronicler.\n- **Option D** (just clean up overlap): Rejected — still too many manual steps.\n- **Chronicler hook on ExitPlanMode**: Rejected in favor of rule — cleaner, no shell script needed, declarative.\n\n## Current State\n\n- Plan saved to docs/plans/plan-08.md (Draft)\n- Beads hierarchy created: root epic marketplace-oau, 8 tasks, 2 gates, 6 dependencies\n- All tasks deferred pending execution start\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Start plan execution (undefer tasks, remove gate)\n- Implement changes starting with hook output (Task 1), then auto-chain rule (Task 2)\n- Parallel track: chronicler rule (Task 6) and chronicler init update (Task 7)\n\n## Related\n\n- Root epic: marketplace-oau\n- Plan file: docs/plans/plan-08.md\n- Key files: plugins/workflows/hooks/exit-plan-gate.sh, plugins/workflows/rules/exit-plan-gate.md, plugins/workflows/rules/engage-the-plan.md, plugins/workflows/skills/engage_plan/SKILL.md","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T09:13:25.303402-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T09:19:04.715125-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T09:19:04.715125-08:00","close_reason":"Processed into diary entry 26-02-08.09-15.auto-chain-planning.md","labels":["plan:08","ys:chronicle","ys:topic:planning"]}

Previously both lived in a single yf.json.\n2. **Preflight does NOT create yf.json**: Only /yf:setup creates config. Preflight only writes lock.json. Tests that assumed preflight created yf.json were updated.\n3. **State file renaming**: Leading dots removed (.task-pump.json → task-pump.json) since .yoshiko-flow/ is already hidden.\n4. **.gitignore reduction**: Removed settings.local.json and CLAUDE.local.md from yf-managed block — Claude Code handles those natively.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Commit all changes\n- Push when user requests\n- Publish v2.11.0 to marketplace\n- Address chronicle auto-capture reliability (user requested recommendations)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T09:12:36.853145-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-13T16:20:31.672059-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T16:20:31.672059-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["plan:24","ys:chronicle","ys:topic:feature"]}

The plan-gate blocks on a definitive signal; missing beads is ambiguous.\n- Subshell with `set +e` for the intake check: under `set -euo pipefail`, `bd list | jq` fails if bd errors in an uninitialized directory.

This was a major namespace migration and structural refactoring.\n\n### Current State\n- `plugins/yf/` contains all 11 skills, 2 agents, 9 rules, 5 hooks, 2 scripts\n- `plugins/workflows/` and `plugins/chronicler/` deleted\n- Lock file renamed: `.claude/plugin-lock.json` → `.claude/yf.json` with `preflight` nesting\n- Migration logic auto-detects old lock format and converts\n- All 143 unit tests passing, 0 failures\n- Plan marked Completed in `docs/plans/plan-13.md`\n\n### Decisions\n- All skill names use `yf:*` namespace (was `workflows:*` / `chronicler:*`)\n- All agent names use `yf_*` prefix (was `chronicler_*`)\n- All rule filenames use `yf-` prefix in both source and target\n- Lock file JSON structure nested under `preflight` key for future extensibility\n- Source rule files in `plugins/yf/rules/` use `yf-` prefixed names (matching their install targets)\n\n### Key Observation\nThe plan lifecycle orchestration system (beads, task pump, chronicles, gates) was NOT used for its own consolidation. Work was done via ad-hoc background Task tool agents. This bypassed: plan_to_beads, plan-exec.sh state machine, task pump dispatch, chronicle capture at boundaries. An investigation bead is being created to understand why the orchestration system failed to activate.\n\n### Files Changed\n- Created: ~35 files in `plugins/yf/`\n- Modified: preflight script, marketplace.json, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, 15 test scenarios\n- Deleted: ~35 files in old plugin dirs + 9 old rules in `.claude/rules/`\n\n### Next Steps\n- Investigate why orchestration system didn't activate (separate bead)\n- Commit and push all changes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:38:29.913159-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T12:48:22.178034-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T12:48:22.178034-08:00","close_reason":"Diary entry generated at docs/diary/26-02-08.12-47.yf-consolidation.md","labels":["ys:chronicle","ys:topic:refactor"]}
{"id":"marketplace-dra","title":"Investigate: Why orchestration system didn't activate for Plan 13","description":"## Problem\n\nPlan 13 (consolidate plugins into yf) was implemented entirely outside the orchestration system that the yf plugin provides. None of the following activated:\n\n1. **No beads created** — `plan_to_beads` was never invoked, so no epic/task hierarchy existed\n2. **No plan gate** — `.claude/.plan-gate` was never created, so code-gate.sh never blocked\n3. **No task pump** — `task_pump` never ran; work was dispatched via ad-hoc Task tool agents\n4. **No chronicles at boundaries** — `plan-transition-chronicle.md` rule didn't fire; no chronicle capture at plan start or completion\n5. **No auto-chain** — The `auto-chain-plan.md` rule didn't fire because ExitPlanMode hook was either not triggered or the plan was loaded from a previous session\n\n## Possible Root Causes\n\n- **Session continuity break**: Plan was drafted in one session, continued in another after context compaction. The auto-chain fires on ExitPlanMode in the *same* session where the plan was written. If the session was compacted between plan creation and execution, the auto-chain signal was lost.\n- **Plan-intake rule didn't catch it**: The `plan-intake.md` rule is supposed to catch manual/pasted plans, but it may not have detected the plan coming from the continuation summary.\n- **Rules not installed**: The old rules in `.claude/rules/` were deleted as part of Plan 13 (Phase 5), but new `yf-` prefixed rules weren't installed yet (preflight hadn't run for the new plugin). So enforcement rules were absent during execution.\n- **Chicken-and-egg**: The system being consolidated was the same system that should have managed the consolidation. Deleting old plugins removed the very hooks and rules that would have enforced the lifecycle.\n\n## Investigation Steps\n\n1. Check if `.claude/rules/` had any rules loaded during the session (they were deleted in Phase 5)\n2. Check if the ExitPlanMode hook fired (look for \"Auto-chaining\" in session transcript)\n3. Check if plan-intake rule was present and could have caught the plan\n4. Determine if there's a gap in the lifecycle for \"self-referential\" changes (modifying the orchestration system itself)\n5.

Implemented fixes and optimizations across 7 files.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Robustness Fixes\n- **Plan detection**: chronicle-check.sh and archive-suggest.sh now filter by `exec:executing` label instead of blindly picking the first open epic. Prevents mistagging when multiple epics are open.\n- **Error visibility**: pre-push-diary.sh changed from `2\u003e/dev/null` to `2\u003e\u00261` on chronicle-check.sh call. Errors now surface in push output while remaining non-blocking.\n- **Fragile arithmetic**: archive-suggest.sh open-bead count replaced fragile `$(( $(...) ))` with subshell `set +e` pattern.\n\n### Optimizations\n- **yf-config.sh**: 3 identical flag-check functions consolidated into `_yf_check_flag` helper (78 → 62 lines)\n- **pre-push-diary.sh**: Duplicate chronicle/archive warning blocks replaced with `warn_open_beads` function (71 → 60 lines)\n- **plugin-preflight.sh**: Duplicate `is_chronicle_rule`/`is_archivist_rule` merged into `is_feature_rule` with thin wrappers\n- **plan-exec.sh**: Dead COUNT variable removed; chronicle gate auto-close extracted from `status` into `close_chronicle_gates` function (no side effects in queries)\n- **pump-state.sh**: Write-only `done` dict removed — `mark-done` just deletes from `dispatched`\n- **code-gate.sh**: Beads safety-net skips entirely when no plan files exist (avoids bd queries on every Edit/Write)\n\n## Decisions\n- Chose to fix plan detection (Option A) and surface errors (Option D) as immediate fixes — low effort, address real issues\n- Deferred archive auto-drafts at pre-push (Option B) — adds parallel system that may not be needed if rule-based suggestions suffice\n- All 7 optimizations implemented — safe, reduce maintenance surface, no behavioral change\n\n## Current State\n- All 275 unit tests pass\n- Version bumped 2.7.0 → 2.7.1\n- CHANGELOG updated with full details\n\n## Files Changed\n- plugins/yf/scripts/yf-config.sh\n- plugins/yf/scripts/chronicle-check.sh\n- plugins/yf/scripts/archive-suggest.sh\n- plugins/yf/scripts/plan-exec.sh\n- plugins/yf/scripts/pump-state.sh\n- plugins/yf/scripts/plugin-preflight.sh\n- plugins/yf/hooks/pre-push-diary.sh\n- plugins/yf/hooks/code-gate.sh\n- plugins/yf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json\n- CHANGELOG.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T22:42:02.207743-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:45:10.496673-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:45:10.496673-08:00","close_reason":"Processed into diary entries","labels":["ys:chronicle","ys:topic:refactoring"]}

{"id":"marketplace-in3","title":"Plan 09: Remove Roles Plugin — Full Rethink","description":"## Summary\nConducted a full rethink of the roles plugin. Analysis revealed the plugin is entirely non-functional:\n- 1 role exists (watch-for-chronicle-worthiness), assigned to primary, but primary has no mechanism to load it\n- 2 chronicler agents have on-start: /roles:apply but zero roles assigned to them\n- 5 skills manage dead infrastructure\n\n## Decision\nDelete the roles plugin entirely. Migrate the one role to a chronicler rule (auto-loaded natively by Claude Code). This fixes the fundamental bug (roles never loaded) and eliminates a cross-plugin dependency.\n\n## Key Rationale\n- Claude Code already has two mechanisms: rules (global, auto-loaded) and agent bodies (per-agent)\n- The roles plugin tried to create a third category but never actually worked\n- watch-for-chronicle-worthiness is safe as a global rule — its triggers only fire during interactive primary sessions\n- Short-lived subagents will never hit the capture trigger conditions\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n- Option B (mixins/agent-centric): Sideways move, doesn't solve primary-session loading\n- Option C (rules with agent filtering): Right long-term answer but requires platform changes\n- Option D (hook-based): Fighting the platform — hook output isn't persistent context\n\n## Plan\n6 phases: migrate role → delete plugin → update docs → clean installed state → add tests → update memory\nSee docs/plans/plan-09.md for full implementation sequence.\n\n## Files Affected\n17 files across chronicler plugin, marketplace config, docs, and installed state","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T09:36:31.571098-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T09:42:41.267599-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T09:42:41.267599-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["ys:chronicle","ys:topic:planning"]}

Agent-specific. This is the dispatch mechanism for 'launch the right agent for this bead.'\n   - TaskCreate/TaskList — shared coordination metadata (Kanban board). Does NOT launch agents. Less capable than beads.\n   - Agent Teams — multiple independent Claude Code sessions. Generic (not specialized). For persistent multi-session coordination.\n\n2. **Beads orchestrates the task orchestration:**\n   - Beads = persistent DAG of work (git-backed, labels, deps, gates)\n   - Task tool subagents = ephemeral execution engine\n   - The task pump reads bd ready, groups by agent:\u003cname\u003e label, dispatches parallel Task tool calls with subagent_type\n\n3. **Solo/Team/Contributor are beads git-flow modes, NOT plugin modes:**\n   - Solo — main branch unprotected, direct push\n   - Team (bd init --team) — dedicated sync branch (beads-sync), shared repo\n   - Contributor (bd init --contributor) — fork-based, separate planning repo, PRs\n   - The workflows plugin respects whatever mode beads is configured with\n\n4. **Chronicler gating to plan execution:**\n   - Chronicle beads captured during execution tagged with plan:\u003cidx\u003e\n   - Chronicle gate bead created by plan_to_beads, closed when plan completes\n   - Diary agent sees the full arc of progress before generating entries\n\n5. **Agent Teams is an optional overlay, not the primary dispatch mechanism:**\n   - TeammateIdle/TaskCompleted hooks are additive enhancements\n   - Core pump works without Agent Teams via Task tool subagents","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:50:22.30118-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:59:22.153853-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T22:59:22.153853-08:00","close_reason":"Diary entry generated: docs/diary/26-02-07.22-50.architecture.md","labels":["plan:07","ys:chronicle","ys:topic:architecture"]}

{"id":"marketplace-yz1","title":"Plan 11: Deterministic Plan Lifecycle \u0026 Chronicle Triggers — planning context","description":"## Summary\n\nDiagnosed why Plan 10 implementation bypassed the entire auto-chain lifecycle. The user exited plan mode with \"clear context and bypass permissions\", creating a new session where \"Implement the following plan:\" was pasted inline. ExitPlanMode was never called in the new session, so the hook never fired.\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n1. **Plan Intake Rule** (the critical fix): Create a new rule `plan-intake.md` that detects when a plan is about to be implemented without the auto-chain having fired, and redirects through the proper lifecycle (save plan → plan_to_beads → plan-exec.sh start → execute_plan).\n\n2. **Skip the hook-based guard**: Considered adding a PreToolUse hook on Edit/Write to warn about missing lifecycle, but rejected due to latency cost on every edit. A rule is sufficient since it has no performance cost.\n\n3. **Semi-automatic chronicle capture at lifecycle boundaries**: Rather than keeping chronicle capture entirely passive, auto-capture at three points: plan start (in plan-intake rule), plan complete (in execute_plan skill), and session close (in BEADS.md Landing the Plane).\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n\nA. Auto-chain depends on single fragile trigger: ExitPlanMode → hook → \"Auto-chaining\" string → rule chain. Context clear breaks the chain.\nB. No fallback detection when plan exists but auto-chain didn't fire.\nC. Chronicle capture entirely passive — `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` only suggests, never auto-captures.\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- Hook-based guard on Edit/Write: Rejected (latency on every file operation)\n- Watching for plan-like markdown patterns: Too fragile, false positives\n- Making auto-chain work across context clears: Not possible — ExitPlanMode is a tool call, can't span sessions\n\n## Files Affected\n\n- `plugins/workflows/rules/plan-intake.md` (new)\n- `plugins/workflows/rules/BEADS.md` (modify — chronicle in Landing the Plane)\n- `plugins/workflows/skills/execute_plan/SKILL.md` (modify — chronicle on completion)\n- `plugins/workflows/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (add artifact, bump version)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dixson3@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T11:10:45.530783-08:00","created_by":"James Dixson","updated_at":"2026-02-08T11:13:46.444692-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T11:13:46.444692-08:00","close_reason":"Planning context captured from plan-11 discussion","labels":["plan:11","ys:chronicle","ys:topic:planning"]}
