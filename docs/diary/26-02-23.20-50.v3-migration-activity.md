## Summary

A draft chronicle captured the sheer volume of activity that passed through the repository in a single 24-hour window. Eight commits landed, touching the marketplace catalog, the changelog, the plugin manifest, preflight declarations, four plan documents, and the specifications -- essentially the entire structural skeleton of the plugin. The commit log tells the story in reverse: Plan 0055 fixed truncated plan IDs in the hybrid idx-hash format, Plan 0056 removed the beads-cli dependency entirely (the v3.0.0 breaking change), Plan 0057 aligned every specification document with the new reality, and Plan 0058 swept up stale terminology that the previous passes had missed.

The `marketplace.json` catalog and `plugin.json` manifest both updated to reflect v3.0.0, with the description synchronized between them. The `preflight.json` declarations changed to match the simplified activation gate -- no more beads-cli binary check. Four new plan documents were committed in sequence, each building on the previous one's completion. The diary entries for Plans 0054 through 0057 were generated in a batch, consolidating the narrative of the migration into the project's permanent record.

What this draft chronicle captured was not any single decision or implementation, but the cadence of a migration that cascaded through layers: runtime first, then specifications, then residual references, each plan discovering work the previous one had exposed. The marketplace infrastructure updated in lockstep, ensuring that any fresh install of the plugin would land on v3.0.0 with clean dependencies and accurate metadata.
