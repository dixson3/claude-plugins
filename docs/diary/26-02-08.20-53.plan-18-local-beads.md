# Diary Entry: Plan 18 — Local-Only Beads Complete

## Summary

Completed Plan 18: Local-Only Beads — Remove Git Tracking and Sync. The `.beads/` directory is now fully local, gitignored, and untracked. This session removed the beads-sync branch, worktree, daemon sync, and all associated git hooks. The `yf-beads.md` session-close protocol was rewritten to eliminate the mandatory push/sync requirement that previously governed session endings. The plugin was bumped to v2.5.0. All 220 unit tests pass. Changes were committed and pushed to main (fca7227).

## Decisions

- Retained informational "bd sync" references in `yf-beads.md` as prohibitions ("Do NOT run bd sync") while removing all instructional uses that previously directed agents to run sync commands
- Used the `--sparse` flag for `git rm` on JSONL files that were managed under sparse-checkout, which was necessary to remove them from tracking without checking them out fully
- Removed the beads worktree before deleting the beads-sync branch, as Git requires the worktree to be cleaned up first

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any residual references to `bd sync` or beads-sync branch in skills, agents, or documentation that may have been missed
- Verify that new sessions initialize cleanly with the local-only beads model (no sync expectations)
- Consider whether any team/contributor workflows need updated documentation now that beads are purely local
