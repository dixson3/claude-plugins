# Diary Entry: Plan 18 — Local-Only Beads Complete

## Summary

Plan 18 continued the thread that Plan 17 had started. After making the plugin's rules and config fully local with symlinks and gitignored files, the natural next step was applying the same treatment to `.beads/` itself. James wanted the beads directory to be purely local -- no git tracking, no sync branch, no daemon. The rationale was consistent with Plan 17: developer tooling state should not pollute a project's git history.

We removed the beads-sync branch, the beads worktree, the daemon sync mechanism, and all associated git hooks. The `.beads/` directory became fully gitignored and untracked. The most significant downstream change was rewriting the `yf-beads.md` session-close protocol, which had previously built around a mandatory push and sync requirement that governed how sessions ended. We rewrote it to eliminate that requirement entirely, while retaining informational references to `bd sync` as explicit prohibitions ("Do NOT run bd sync") to prevent agents from invoking the now-removed functionality.

The teardown order mattered: we removed the beads worktree before deleting the beads-sync branch, since Git requires the worktree to be cleaned up first. For the JSONL files that were managed under sparse-checkout, we used the `--sparse` flag with `git rm` to remove them from tracking without checking them out fully. The plugin was bumped to v2.5.0, all 220 unit tests passed, and the changes were committed and pushed to main at fca7227. With this change, the yf plugin leaves a truly minimal footprint -- no committed artifacts outside its own `plugins/yf/` directory.

## Decisions

- Retained informational "bd sync" references in `yf-beads.md` as prohibitions ("Do NOT run bd sync") while removing all instructional uses that previously directed agents to run sync commands
- Used the `--sparse` flag for `git rm` on JSONL files that were managed under sparse-checkout, which was necessary to remove them from tracking without checking them out fully
- Removed the beads worktree before deleting the beads-sync branch, as Git requires the worktree to be cleaned up first

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any residual references to `bd sync` or beads-sync branch in skills, agents, or documentation that may have been missed
- Verify that new sessions initialize cleanly with the local-only beads model (no sync expectations)
- Consider whether any team/contributor workflows need updated documentation now that beads are purely local
