## Summary

Fixed a pattern mismatch in `beads-setup.sh` related to Dolt Lock Health detection. The 'Dolt Lock Health' pattern was not matching the expected output format, causing false negatives in health checks. This fix resolves GitHub issue #33 and ensures that beads-setup correctly detects Dolt lock status during setup operations.

The fix involved correcting the regex pattern or string matching logic in the beads-setup health check function to accurately detect and validate Dolt lock health status, improving the reliability of the setup process.
