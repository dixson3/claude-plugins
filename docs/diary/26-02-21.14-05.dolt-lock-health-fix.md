## Summary

We hit a false negative in the beads-setup health checks: the grep pattern for "Dolt Lock Health" in `beads-setup.sh` did not match the actual output format from `bd doctor`, causing the health check to silently pass when it should have flagged an issue. This had been tracked as GitHub issue #33 since its discovery during Plan 49 work. We corrected the regex pattern in the health check function to accurately detect and validate dolt lock status, restoring the reliability of the setup process. A small fix, but an important one -- silent false negatives in health checks erode trust in the entire doctor-driven repair model we built in Plan 48.
