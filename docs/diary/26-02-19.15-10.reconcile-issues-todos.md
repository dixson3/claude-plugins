## Summary

Plan 47 was executed to full completion, reconciling all GitHub issues against the project's TODO register. The plan followed five phases: closing resolved GitHub issues, pruning completed TODOs, linking TODOs to GitHub issues, creating new GitHub issues for unlinked TODOs, and rewriting the TODO register.

Ten resolved GitHub issues were closed with comments confirming their resolution. Eight completed TODO items were moved to a new Completed section in the register. Thirteen new GitHub issues (#18 through #30) were created to cover all open TODOs that lacked issue references, with related testing TODOs grouped into four shared issues to reduce noise. A new GitHub column with direct links was added to `docs/specifications/TODO.md`, ensuring every active TODO now has a corresponding GitHub issue reference. The final register state was 19 open and 11 closed items.

Following Plan 47 completion, Plan 48 work was committed in the same session. This included updates to the TODO register reflecting the new resolved items (TODO-014, TODO-027) and new entries (TODO-031, TODO-032, TODO-033), a session diary entry, and the beads setup skill with integration test infrastructure. Significant files touched in that follow-up work included `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `plugin.json`, `preflight.json`, `DEVELOPERS.md`, `beads-setup.sh`, `plugin-preflight.sh`, and the `beads_setup/SKILL.md` skill file.

## Decisions

- Related testing TODOs were grouped into shared GitHub issues rather than creating one issue per TODO, reducing issue count and keeping related work co-located.
- The TODO register was restructured to include a GitHub issue column with direct links, making cross-referencing between the register and the issue tracker immediate.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Triage the 19 open TODOs by priority for upcoming plan cycles
- [ ] Verify all 13 newly created GitHub issues (#18-#30) have appropriate labels and milestones
- [ ] Consider periodic re-reconciliation as TODOs are resolved in future plans
