## Summary

After several rapid plan cycles (Plans 42-48), we had accumulated a growing disconnect between the GitHub issue tracker and the project's TODO register in `docs/specifications/TODO.md`. Some issues had been silently resolved by recent plans without being closed, several TODOs lacked corresponding issues, and there was no reliable way to cross-reference between the two. James wanted them reconciled before we moved on to new feature work.

We executed Plan 47's reconciliation in five phases. First, we closed ten resolved GitHub issues with comments confirming their resolution. Then we pruned eight completed TODO items into a new Completed section in the register. From there, we audited every open TODO that lacked a GitHub issue reference and created thirteen new issues (#18 through #30) to fill the gaps, grouping related testing TODOs into four shared issues to avoid noise. Finally, we added a new GitHub column with direct links to `docs/specifications/TODO.md`, ensuring every active TODO now has a traceable issue reference. The final register stood at 19 open and 11 closed items.

Following the reconciliation, we committed Plan 48 work in the same session. This included TODO register updates reflecting newly resolved items (TODO-014, TODO-027) and new entries (TODO-031, TODO-032, TODO-033), along with the beads setup skill, integration test infrastructure, and supporting documentation. Significant files touched in that follow-up included `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `plugin.json`, `preflight.json`, `DEVELOPERS.md`, `beads-setup.sh`, `plugin-preflight.sh`, and `beads_setup/SKILL.md`.

## Decisions

- Related testing TODOs were grouped into shared GitHub issues rather than creating one issue per TODO, reducing issue count and keeping related work co-located.
- The TODO register was restructured to include a GitHub issue column with direct links, making cross-referencing between the register and the issue tracker immediate.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Triage the 19 open TODOs by priority for upcoming plan cycles
- [ ] Verify all 13 newly created GitHub issues (#18-#30) have appropriate labels and milestones
- [ ] Consider periodic re-reconciliation as TODOs are resolved in future plans
