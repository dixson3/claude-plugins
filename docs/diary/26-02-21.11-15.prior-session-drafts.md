# Diary Entry: Prior Session Draft Chronicles

## Summary

We opened this session to find several draft chronicles left open from prior sessions that needed consolidation. The drafts covered two threads: a beads-setup pattern mismatch fix from Plan 49 (tracked as GitHub issue #33) and routine Plan 48 documentation changes. The beads-setup fix had corrected a "Dolt Lock Health" pattern mismatch in `beads-setup.sh` where the health check grep pattern did not match the actual dolt output format, resolved in commit 47200e2. A checkpoint chronicle also recorded one task that had been in progress at a context boundary. We consolidated all four drafts into this single entry to clear the backlog before starting Plan 50 work.

## Decisions

- No significant decisions — these were routine bugfix and documentation maintenance activities.
