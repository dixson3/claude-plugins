# Diary Entry: Prior Session Draft Chronicles

**Date**: 2026-02-21 11:15
**Topics**: bugfix, maintenance
**Chronicle IDs**: yf-118, yf-6zr, yf-w7k, yf-aox

## Summary

Consolidated draft chronicles from prior sessions that were left open. These cover two topics: a beads-setup pattern mismatch fix (Plan 49, issue #33) and routine plan-48 documentation changes.

The beads-setup fix corrected a 'Dolt Lock Health' pattern mismatch in `beads-setup.sh` where the health check grep pattern didn't match the actual dolt output format. This was tracked as GitHub issue #33 and resolved in commit 47200e2.

A checkpoint chronicle recorded 1 task in progress at the time of a context boundary.

## Decisions

- No significant decisions — these were routine bugfix and documentation maintenance activities.
