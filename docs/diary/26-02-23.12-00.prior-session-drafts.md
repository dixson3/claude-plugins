# Diary Entry: Prior Session Wrap-Up (Plans 0054-0055)

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Operator**: James Dixson
**Topics**: maintenance, plan-lifecycle, hybrid-ids
**Chronicle IDs**: yf-but, yf-e6f

## Summary

Two draft chronicles from earlier sessions captured the tail end of Plans 0054 and 0055 before the day pivoted to the v3.0.0 migration work.

Plan 0054 had threaded operator attribution through the lifecycle and restyled the diary agent from a release-notes generator into a narrative journal writer. Plan 0055 followed with a targeted fix: plan IDs were being truncated during bead creation because the hybrid `idx-hash` format wasn't propagating consistently across all skills. The fix touched `plan_create_beads`, `plan_engage`, `plan_execute`, and several other skills to ensure the full `0055-57c3s` format survived from plan save through bead labeling.

The marketplace catalog description was also synced with the plugin manifest in a small maintenance commit (`0da084d`), keeping the two sources of truth aligned after the v2.30.0 feature additions.

These were the last changes made under the beads-cli regime. The very next commit (`9c85bd6`) would remove beads-cli entirely.

## Decisions

- No new decisions -- these chronicles document completion of prior plan work.
