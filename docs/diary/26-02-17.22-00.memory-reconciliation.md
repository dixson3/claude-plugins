## Summary

We had been watching James manually perform MEMORY.md hygiene at the end of sessions -- reading each item, cross-referencing it against specifications and CLAUDE.md, classifying it as stale or contradictory or worth promoting, and then cleaning up. It was exactly the kind of repetitive analytical work that should be automated. Plan 43 turned that manual process into the `/yf:memory_reconcile` skill.

The skill reads MEMORY.md and classifies each item into one of three categories that mirror what James was already doing by hand: contradictions (items conflicting with specs or CLAUDE.md), gaps (knowledge not yet captured in specs that should be promoted), and ephemeral duplicates (items restating conventions already documented elsewhere). For each category, it recommends concrete actions -- fix, promote, or remove.

We integrated the skill into Rule 4.2 "Landing the Plane" as step 4.5, placing it after context capture but before quality gates. This means every session close now includes an automated memory drift check, catching the kind of staleness that used to accumulate silently between manual sweeps.

The plan started with 10 beads spanning specification additions, skill implementation, rule integration, and testing. We added REQ-037 for the memory reconciliation requirement, FS-042 for classification semantics, UC-037 in `docs/specifications/IG/chronicler.md` for the use case, and TODO-029 for end-to-end validation. The new skill lives at `plugins/yf/skills/memory_reconcile/SKILL.md`, with 7 test cases in `tests/scenarios/unit-memory-reconcile.yaml` covering existence checks. The three-category classification was a deliberate choice to match James's observed workflow rather than inventing abstract categories that might miss the point.

## Decisions

- Memory reconciliation was placed at step 4.5 in the session close protocol (Rule 4.2), running before quality gates and after context capture, so that memory is clean before the final commit.
- The three-category classification (contradictions, gaps, ephemeral duplicates) was chosen to match the operator's observed manual workflow rather than inventing new categories.

## Next Steps

- [ ] TODO-029: End-to-end validation of memory reconciliation in a real session close
- [ ] Consider adding memory reconciliation to swarm completion bridges (Rule 5.1) for long-running swarms
