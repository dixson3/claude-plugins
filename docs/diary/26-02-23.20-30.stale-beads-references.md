# Diary Entry: Mopping Up After the Migration -- Plan 0058

## Summary

The v3.0.0 migration (Plan 0056) had rewritten the engine and Plan 0057 had aligned the specifications, but when James launched a fresh session and watched the preflight fail with "command not found" errors, it became clear that the migration had left one more layer untouched. The cached plugin copy at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` still contained pre-v3.0.0 code calling `yf_bd_available()` -- a function that no longer existed. That cache staleness was the immediate pain, but a grep through the source revealed three more files with residual `bead` terminology that Plan 0056's sweep had missed.

Plan 0058 was small and surgical. The `plugin_setup/SKILL.md` lost its entire "Beads CLI Dependency Check" section -- in v3.0.0, only `jq` needs to be present, and the preflight script already handles that. Two dispatch skills (`plan_execute/SKILL.md` and `plan_pump/SKILL.md`) each had a `parent_bead:` parameter in their swarm invocation templates that became `parent_task:`. The issue triage agent (`yf_issue_triage.md`) had `source_beads` in both its description and JSON example, now `source_tasks`. Four files, four simple renames, one section removal.

The real lesson was about migration completeness. Plan 0056 touched 91 files, Plan 0057 swept the specifications, and Plan 0058 caught the stragglers -- each pass found references the previous one had missed, because different grep patterns catch different shapes of the same concept. Historical plan documents and code comments that correctly describe what was removed were deliberately left intact; the goal was accuracy, not erasure. A verification grep across all active plugin code confirmed zero functional beads-cli references remained.
