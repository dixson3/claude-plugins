# Diary Entry: Archivist Capability Implementation (Plan 19)

**Date**: 2026-02-08 22:44
**Topics**: feature, architecture
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-c41

## Summary

Implemented Plan 19, adding a full archivist capability to the yf plugin. The archivist captures research findings and design decisions as permanent, indexed documentation — complementing the chronicler's ephemeral session context with durable project knowledge.

## What Was Built

- 4 skills (`yf:archive`, `yf:archive_process`, `yf:archive_disable`, `yf:archive_suggest`)
- 1 agent (`yf_archivist`) that converts archive beads into structured SUMMARY.md files with index management
- 2 rules for detecting archive-worthy moments during work and plan transitions
- 1 script (`archive-suggest.sh`) that scans git commits for research/decision activity keywords
- 4 test scenarios covering config toggles, preflight, commit scanning, and pre-push integration

Output structure: `docs/research/<topic>/SUMMARY.md` and `docs/decisions/DEC-NNN-<slug>/SUMMARY.md` with `_index.md` files.

## Key Decisions

- **Followed the chronicler pattern exactly**: config flag, conditional preflight, suggest-don't-capture rules. This consistency makes the system predictable.
- **Advisory pre-push warnings**: Open archive beads trigger a warning but never block push, matching the chronicle behavior.
- **No auto-capture**: Rules only suggest archiving, the user decides. Avoids noise from false positives in research/decision keyword detection.
- **Index files created lazily**: `_index.md` files are written by the archivist agent on first process, not pre-seeded by preflight.

## Impact

- 1,631 lines added across 24 files
- All 255 unit tests passing
- Plugin version 2.5.0 -> 2.6.0
