# Diary Entry: Marketplace Configuration Updates

**Date**: 2026-02-13 18:00

**Topics**: marketplace, configuration
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-m29

## Summary

We took a brief detour for routine marketplace housekeeping in this session. Four commits updated `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `README.md` with a name change to the marketplace catalog and minor configuration adjustments. These were the kind of small metadata corrections that accumulate when the plugin evolves faster than its registry entries -- nothing architectural, just keeping the marketplace metadata current with the plugin's actual state.

## Decisions

- No significant architectural or design decisions in this batch -- purely metadata and naming updates.
