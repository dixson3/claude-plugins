**Topics**: marketplace, configuration
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-m29

## Summary

Minor marketplace maintenance: four commits updating `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `README.md`. Changes included a name update to the marketplace catalog and configuration adjustments. These are routine housekeeping changes that keep the marketplace metadata current with the plugin registry.

## Decisions

- No significant architectural or design decisions in this batch — purely metadata and naming updates.
