# Diary Entry: Remove Roles Plugin — Inline to Rules

**Topics**: refactor, planning
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-in3

## Summary

Coming off the auto-chain work in Plan 08, we turned our attention to the roles plugin and conducted a full rethink of its value. What we found was sobering: the entire plugin was dead infrastructure. It provided five skills and a shell script for per-agent behavioral instructions, but none of it was actually functioning. The sole role, `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness`, was assigned to `primary`, but primary had no mechanism to auto-load it. Both chronicler agents (`chronicler_recall` and `chronicler_diary`) had `on-start: /roles:apply` directives that matched zero assigned roles. Every piece of the roles machinery was wired up but connected to nothing.

James made the call to delete rather than refactor. We evaluated four alternatives -- mixins, rules with agent filtering, hook-based loading, a hybrid approach -- but all of them added complexity to solve a problem that Claude Code's native mechanisms already handle. Rules cover global behaviors, and agent body markdown covers agent-specific behaviors. There was no gap for the roles plugin to fill.

We removed `plugins/roles/` entirely, taking out five skills, one script, and roughly 530 lines of code. The one piece worth keeping, `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness`, was migrated from a role to a chronicler rule installed to `.claude/rules/`, where Claude Code auto-loads it natively. This also simplified `chronicler:init` from six steps to four and eliminated the cross-plugin dependency that had chronicler depending on roles. The cleanup was clean and satisfying -- sometimes the best refactor is a deletion.

## Decisions

- **Delete vs. simplify**: Chose deletion over refactoring. The plugin solved a problem (per-agent behavioral instructions) that Claude Code's native mechanisms already handle: rules for global behaviors, agent body markdown for agent-specific behaviors.
- **Global rule is safe**: The `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` content works as a global rule because its trigger conditions (completing features, architecture decisions) only fire during interactive primary-session work. Short-lived subagents never encounter these triggers.
- **No replacement needed**: Evaluated 4 alternatives (mixins, rules with agent filtering, hook-based loading, hybrid). All added complexity without solving the fundamental issue. The simplest answer was to use what already works.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor whether `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` as a global rule causes any noise in subagent output
- [ ] Consider proposing `applies-to` support for rules upstream to Anthropic if per-agent filtering becomes genuinely needed
