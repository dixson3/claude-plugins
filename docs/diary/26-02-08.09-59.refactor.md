# Diary Entry: Remove Roles Plugin — Inline to Rules

**Date**: 2026-02-08 09:59
**Topics**: refactor, planning
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-in3

## Summary

Conducted a full rethink of the roles plugin and determined it was non-functional. The plugin provided 5 skills and a shell script for per-agent behavioral instructions, but in practice:

- The sole role (`watch-for-chronicle-worthiness`) was assigned to `primary`, but primary had no mechanism to auto-load it
- Both chronicler agents (`chronicler_recall`, `chronicler_diary`) had `on-start: /roles:apply` directives that matched zero assigned roles
- The entire plugin was dead infrastructure

Deleted `plugins/roles/` entirely (5 skills, 1 script, ~530 lines removed). Migrated `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` from a role to a chronicler rule installed to `.claude/rules/`, where Claude Code auto-loads it natively. Simplified `chronicler:init` from 6 steps to 4. Removed the cross-plugin dependency (chronicler no longer depends on roles).

## Decisions

- **Delete vs. simplify**: Chose deletion over refactoring. The plugin solved a problem (per-agent behavioral instructions) that Claude Code's native mechanisms already handle: rules for global behaviors, agent body markdown for agent-specific behaviors.
- **Global rule is safe**: The `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` content works as a global rule because its trigger conditions (completing features, architecture decisions) only fire during interactive primary-session work. Short-lived subagents never encounter these triggers.
- **No replacement needed**: Evaluated 4 alternatives (mixins, rules with agent filtering, hook-based loading, hybrid). All added complexity without solving the fundamental issue. The simplest answer was to use what already works.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor whether `watch-for-chronicle-worthiness` as a global rule causes any noise in subagent output
- [ ] Consider proposing `applies-to` support for rules upstream to Anthropic if per-agent filtering becomes genuinely needed
