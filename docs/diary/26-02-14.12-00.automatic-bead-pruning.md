## Summary

Plan 30 manually pruned 278 closed beads from the database -- a nuclear cleanup that confirmed no content was lost since all context lived in diary entries, plan docs, and CHANGELOG. Plan 32 then systematized that manual process into automatic pruning at two trigger points: plan completion (plan-scoped) and git push (global).

The `plan-prune.sh` script provides two subcommands: `plan <label>` soft-deletes closed beads for a specific plan, and `global` runs `bd admin cleanup` against all stale closed beads older than a configurable threshold (default 7 days) plus ephemeral wisps. Both are fail-open and configurable via `.yoshiko-flow/config.json` under `auto_prune`.

Integration points: `plan-exec.sh` calls plan-scoped prune in a fail-open subshell when status returns `completed`, and a new `PostToolUse` hook (`post-push-prune.sh`) runs global prune after `git push` then syncs the pruned state to beads-sync.

## Decisions

- **Soft delete only** -- tombstones with 30-day recovery window, never hard deletes, preventing resurrection issues from old beads-sync clones
- **Fail-open everywhere** -- prune errors never block plan completion or push operations (exit 0 always)
- **PostToolUse over PreToolUse** -- prune runs *after* the push succeeds, ensuring code is safely remote before any cleanup
- **Two-step push sequence** -- code pushes first, then prune runs, then `bd sync` pushes the pruned beads state as an incremental update to beads-sync

## Artifacts

- `plugins/yf/scripts/plan-prune.sh` -- core prune script (plan/global subcommands, --dry-run)
- `plugins/yf/hooks/post-push-prune.sh` -- PostToolUse hook for global prune on push
- `plugins/yf/scripts/yf-config.sh` -- added `yf_is_prune_on_complete()`, `yf_is_prune_on_push()`
- `plugins/yf/scripts/plan-exec.sh` -- integrated plan-scoped prune at completion
- `plugins/yf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` -- added PostToolUse hook section, v2.15.0
- `tests/scenarios/unit-plan-prune.yaml` -- 8 test cases
- `tests/scenarios/unit-yf-config.yaml` -- 4 new config test cases (cases 8-11)

## Live Verification

The auto-prune fired during its own implementation: when plan-32 completed, `plan-exec.sh status` automatically pruned 12 closed beads. Self-testing in production.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Manual verification: complete a plan, confirm closed beads pruned
- [ ] Manual verification: `git push`, confirm global cleanup runs
- [ ] Config test: set `on_plan_complete: false`, confirm prune skipped
