# Diary Entry: Operator Attribution and Narrative Diary Restyle (Plan 0054)

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Operator**: James Dixson
**Topics**: operator-identity, diary-style, plan-lifecycle, attribution
**Chronicle IDs**: yf-mfe, yf-vcs

## Summary

After weeks of diary entries that read like release notes, James raised the question that had been nagging since the early plans: who is directing all this work, and why do our records sound like they were written by a build system? The yf plugin tracked what changed and when, but never captured who was steering. Plan 0054 set out to fix both problems at once -- threading operator identity into the lifecycle and teaching the diary agent to tell stories instead of listing facts.

The foundation was a single `yf_operator_name()` function in `plugins/yf/scripts/yf-config.sh`, built as a four-step fallback cascade: project config, plugin manifest, git identity, and finally a hard "Unknown" default. Every downstream consumer -- plan gates, index entries, archive templates, diary output -- resolves through this one function rather than inventing its own lookup. We seeded it into `plugins/yf/skills/plugin_setup/SKILL.md` so new projects get operator attribution from their first `/yf:plugin_setup` run without an extra question.

The operator field rippled outward from there. `plugins/yf/hooks/exit-plan-gate.sh` gained an Operator column in both the gate JSON and the `docs/plans/_index.md` registry, and we backfilled all 55 existing plan rows with James Dixson. Archive templates in `plugins/yf/skills/archive_capture/SKILL.md` and `plugins/yf/agents/yf_archive_process.md` picked up the same field for research and decision records.

The narrative restyle was the more subjective half. We rewrote the diary agent's guidelines in `plugins/yf/agents/yf_chronicle_diary.md` to demand first-person plural voice, past tense, and story arc -- opening with motivation, connecting to prior work, and closing with forward momentum. Three existing diary entries served as proof of concept, each restyled from factual bullet points into connected narratives that name the operator when describing direction. The plan also saved a chronicle at its ExitPlanMode boundary, capturing the design intent before implementation began.

All 915 tests passed at completion. The yf plugin's records now carry both a human voice and a human name.
