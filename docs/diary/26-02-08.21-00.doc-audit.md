# Diary Entry: Documentation Audit & Version Alignment

**Date**: 2026-02-08 21:00
**Topics**: documentation, versioning, cleanup
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-rum, marketplace-6ja

## Summary

After completing Plan 17 (symlink-based preflight) and simplifying the config model to a single gitignored `yf.json`, performed a systematic review of all project documentation and manifest files. Found and fixed version mismatches, stale references, and missing content across 5 files.

## Changes

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated v2.4.0 entry to reflect single-file config model (`yf.json` not `yf.local.json`), documented removal of all migration logic and test files
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added `tests/` to repository structure tree, replaced hardcoded absolute paths with relative `--plugin-dir .`, clarified rules are "symlinked into" `.claude/rules/`
- **README.md**: Bumped version 2.0.0 to 2.4.0, added 3 missing skills (`/yf:task_pump`, `/yf:plan_intake`, `/yf:setup`), added `preflight.json` to plugin structure, replaced hardcoded path, added `tests/` to repo structure, fixed "commands" to "skills, agents, and rules"
- **plugins/yf/README.md**: Added version `v2.4.0` to header, added `/yf:plan_intake` and `/yf:setup` to skills tables, added Configuration section documenting `yf.json`, fixed Draft lifecycle row to mention auto-chain
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped both marketplace and plugin versions from 2.1.0 to 2.4.0

## Decisions

- Version alignment: all manifests, READMEs, and CHANGELOG now consistently reference v2.4.0
- Relative paths preferred over absolute in documentation for portability
- Config section added to yf README since the single-file model is simple enough to document inline

## Next Steps

- [x] All 208 tests passing
- [x] All documentation consistent at v2.4.0
