# Diary Entry: Documentation Audit & Version Alignment

**Date**: 2026-02-08 21:00
**Operator**: James Dixson
**Topics**: documentation, versioning, cleanup
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-rum, marketplace-6ja

## Summary

After the rapid succession of Plan 17 (symlink-based preflight) and the config simplification that followed, we paused to take stock of the documentation. The plugin had evolved from v2.0.0 through several plans in a single day, and James wanted to make sure the docs reflected reality before moving on. We performed a systematic review of all project documentation and manifest files, and the drift was worse than expected.

The root `README.md` still referenced v2.0.0 and was missing three skills that had been added since the consolidation: `/yf:task_pump`, `/yf:plan_intake`, and `/yf:setup`. The `plugins/yf/README.md` had no version number at all and was missing the same skills from its tables. `CLAUDE.md` was still using hardcoded absolute paths instead of relative `--plugin-dir .` and did not include the `tests/` directory in its repository structure tree. `CHANGELOG.md`'s v2.4.0 entry still referenced `yf.local.json` instead of the simplified `yf.json`. And `marketplace.json` was two major versions behind.

We worked through each file methodically -- bumping versions to v2.4.0 across all manifests and READMEs, adding the missing skills, updating the repository structure trees, replacing hardcoded paths with relative ones, and correcting the CHANGELOG to reflect the single-file config model. The audit was not glamorous work, but it brought everything into alignment after a day of rapid structural changes. All 208 tests remained green throughout.

## Changes

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated v2.4.0 entry to reflect single-file config model (`yf.json` not `yf.local.json`), documented removal of all migration logic and test files
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added `tests/` to repository structure tree, replaced hardcoded absolute paths with relative `--plugin-dir .`, clarified rules are "symlinked into" `.claude/rules/`
- **README.md**: Bumped version 2.0.0 to 2.4.0, added 3 missing skills (`/yf:task_pump`, `/yf:plan_intake`, `/yf:setup`), added `preflight.json` to plugin structure, replaced hardcoded path, added `tests/` to repo structure, fixed "commands" to "skills, agents, and rules"
- **plugins/yf/README.md**: Added version `v2.4.0` to header, added `/yf:plan_intake` and `/yf:setup` to skills tables, added Configuration section documenting `yf.json`, fixed Draft lifecycle row to mention auto-chain
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped both marketplace and plugin versions from 2.1.0 to 2.4.0

## Decisions

- Version alignment: all manifests, READMEs, and CHANGELOG now consistently reference v2.4.0
- Relative paths preferred over absolute in documentation for portability
- Config section added to yf README since the single-file model is simple enough to document inline

## Next Steps

- [x] All 208 tests passing
- [x] All documentation consistent at v2.4.0
