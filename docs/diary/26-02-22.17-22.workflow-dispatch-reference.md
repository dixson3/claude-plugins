# Diary Entry: Workflow Dispatch Model Reference Document

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Topics**: planning, architecture, dispatch
**Chronicle IDs**: yf-d51

## Summary

Saved a comprehensive reference document (plan:8izyz) mapping the complete decision tree for work dispatch in the yf plugin. The document defines three dispatch modes -- Inline (lead agent executes directly for bead creation, state transitions, validation), Bare Subagent (single Task call for atomic single-file tasks), and Swarm (`/yf:swarm_run` with multi-step formulas for complex research-implement-review workflows). This is a reference document capturing existing behavior, not an implementation plan. The plan file is at `docs/plans/plan-8izyz.md`.
