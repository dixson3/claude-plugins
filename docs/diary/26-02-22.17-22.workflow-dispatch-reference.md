# Diary Entry: Workflow Dispatch Model Reference Document

## Summary

As the plugin's execution model grew more complex across Plans 42-50, we realized there was no single document mapping the complete decision tree for how work gets dispatched. We saved a comprehensive reference document (plan:8izyz at `docs/plans/plan-8izyz.md`) that defines the three dispatch modes the plugin uses: Inline, where the lead agent executes directly for bead creation, state transitions, and validation; Bare Subagent, where a single Task call handles atomic single-file work; and Swarm, where `/yf:swarm_run` orchestrates multi-step formulas for complex research-implement-review workflows. This is a reference document capturing existing behavior, not an implementation plan -- we wrote it to codify what had emerged organically so that future planning sessions have a clear map of the dispatch landscape.
