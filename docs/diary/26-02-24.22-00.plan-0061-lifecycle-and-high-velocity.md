## Summary

Plan 0061 had come and gone fast enough that the chronicle system missed its lifecycle boundaries entirely. When `chronicle-validate.sh` ran its post-hoc audit, it found no save/intake chronicle and no start chronicle for Plan 0061-k62y7, so it generated fallback entries to preserve the historical record. The plan itself -- fixing the `yft_mol_wisp()` JSON validation bug, correcting fabricated diary claims, and adding the Step 4.5 fact-check to the diary agent -- had already been captured in a prior diary entry from its manually-created chronicles. These fallbacks were the validator doing its job: stitching the seams that rapid execution left behind.

The completion chronicle told the cleaner story. Plan 0061 closed with all four tasks done: the mol wisp bugfix, the two diary corrections, and the fact-check addition to `plugins/yf/agents/yf_chronicle_diary.md`. No tasks left open, no stragglers.

But the more interesting signal came from the two draft chronicles that `chronicle-check.sh` auto-detected. Both flagged the same pattern from different vantage points: 14 and 16 commits respectively, touching `marketplace.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and plan files spanning Plans 0056 through 0061. This was the v3.0.0 migration wave making itself visible in aggregate. Plan 0056 had ripped out the beads-cli dependency and rebuilt the task system on flat JSON files. Plan 0057 aligned the specifications. Plan 0058 cleaned stale bead terminology from skills and agents. Plan 0059 audited and fixed the test suite against v3.0.0 specs. Plan 0060 automated cleanup of the artifacts those plans left behind. And Plan 0061 caught the bugs and inaccuracies that only surface after the dust settles.

Six plans in roughly two days, each one building on the last, each one touching the marketplace catalog as the version description grew. The drafts captured what no individual plan chronicle could: the cumulative shape of a migration sprint. James had been pushing the lifecycle hard, and the chronicle system's draft detection -- watching for high commit volumes and significant file churn -- proved its value by flagging the pattern even when individual plan chronicles were already covering the pieces.

## Decisions

- The two draft chronicles were consolidated into this single diary entry rather than spawning separate entries, since they captured overlapping commit windows (14 vs 16 commits from the same 24-hour period) and told the same story from slightly different offsets.
- Fallback chronicles were included in this entry rather than being closed as duplicates, because they document a real gap in the lifecycle record that the validator filled.
