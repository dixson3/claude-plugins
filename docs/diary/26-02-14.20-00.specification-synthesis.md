# Diary Entry: Initial Specification Synthesis from Project History

**Date**: 2026-02-14 20:00
**Topics**: engineer-specs, specifications, project-analysis
**Chronicle IDs**: marketplace-ml3

## Summary

Ran the newly implemented `engineer_analyze_project` capability against the d3-claude-plugins project itself, producing the first complete specification document set. The `yf_engineer_synthesizer` agent scanned all 34 plans, 24 diary entries, and the full plugin artifact inventory (skills, agents, rules, scripts, hooks) to synthesize specifications from project history rather than from scratch.

The synthesis produced four document types under `docs/specifications/`:

- **PRD**: 31 requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-031), 10 technical constraints, and 33 functional specifications organized across 8 capability areas (plan lifecycle, swarm execution, chronicler, archivist, engineer, marketplace, beads integration, and context persistence).
- **EDD/CORE**: 12 design decisions (DD-001 through DD-012) in ADR format covering architecture choices like the beads-over-tasks orchestration model and the JSON-return agent pattern, plus 7 non-functional requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-007).
- **IG**: 7 implementation guides with 28 use cases (UC-001 through UC-028) covering the major workflows -- plan lifecycle, swarm execution, chronicler, archivist, engineer, marketplace operations, and beads integration.
- **TODO**: 18 items prioritized across P1 (3), P2 (8), P3 (4), and completed (4).

During the synthesis, three P1 issues were identified and fixed immediately: the marketplace.json and root README.md both referenced version 2.11.0 instead of the current 2.17.0, and plans 24 and 26 were still marked as Draft despite being completed work. All three were corrected in the same session.

## Decisions

- **Synthesize from history rather than author from scratch** -- the project has 34 plans and 24 diary entries containing extensive design rationale, so extracting specifications from existing artifacts produces higher-fidelity documents than writing them de novo
- **Fix P1 issues immediately** -- the version drift (2.11.0 in marketplace.json and README.md vs. actual 2.17.0) and stale plan statuses were corrected during the synthesis session rather than filed as separate tasks, since they were trivial fixes discovered during the analysis pass

## Next Steps

- [ ] Commit specification files under `docs/specifications/`
- [ ] Update plugin cache to include the new specifications directory
- [ ] Run `/yf:engineer_reconcile` to validate specs against current codebase state
- [ ] Process any remaining open chronicles into diary entries
