# Diary Entry: Initial Specification Synthesis from Project History

## Summary

With the Engineer capability freshly implemented in v2.17.0, we turned it on ourselves -- running `engineer_analyze_project` against the d3-claude-plugins project to produce its first complete specification document set. Rather than authoring specs from scratch, James wanted to synthesize them from the project's own history: 34 plans, 24 diary entries, and the full plugin artifact inventory of skills, agents, rules, scripts, and hooks. The premise was that a project with this much documented design rationale would produce higher-fidelity specifications through extraction than through de novo authoring.

The `yf_engineer_synthesizer` agent scanned the full corpus and produced four document types under `docs/specifications/`. The PRD captured 31 requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-031) with 10 technical constraints and 33 functional specifications organized across 8 capability areas. The EDD documented 12 design decisions in ADR format, including foundational choices like the beads-over-tasks orchestration model and the JSON-return agent pattern, plus 7 non-functional requirements. The IG laid out 7 implementation guides with 28 use cases covering every major workflow. The TODO register cataloged 18 items across priority tiers.

The synthesis run also served as a quality gate for the project's metadata. Three P1 issues surfaced immediately: both `marketplace.json` and the root `README.md` still referenced version 2.11.0 instead of the current 2.17.0, and plans 24 and 26 were marked Draft despite being completed work. We corrected all three in the same session rather than filing them as separate tasks -- they were trivial fixes discovered during the analysis pass, and there was no reason to defer them.

## Decisions

- **Synthesize from history rather than author from scratch** -- the project has 34 plans and 24 diary entries containing extensive design rationale, so extracting specifications from existing artifacts produces higher-fidelity documents than writing them de novo
- **Fix P1 issues immediately** -- the version drift (2.11.0 in marketplace.json and README.md vs. actual 2.17.0) and stale plan statuses were corrected during the synthesis session rather than filed as separate tasks, since they were trivial fixes discovered during the analysis pass

## Next Steps

- [ ] Commit specification files under `docs/specifications/`
- [ ] Update plugin cache to include the new specifications directory
- [ ] Run `/yf:engineer_reconcile` to validate specs against current codebase state
- [ ] Process any remaining open chronicles into diary entries
