# Diary Entry: Specification Alignment for v3.0.0 (Plan 0057)

**Date**: 2026-02-23

## Summary

Plan 0056 had changed the engine, but the manual still described the old one. Every specification document -- EDD, PRD, all nine Implementation Guides, the test coverage matrix, the TODO tracker, and the runtime rules file -- still spoke fluent beads-cli. Commands like `bd create`, paths like `.beads/dolt/`, concepts like "three-condition activation" and "dolt-native persistence" were woven through hundreds of lines of carefully structured specification text. Plan 0057 was a documentation-only plan to bring all of it into alignment with the v3.0.0 reality.

The work parallelized naturally. Seven agents ran simultaneously, each owning a group of files: EDD/CORE.md got the heaviest treatment with eight design decisions rewritten or marked superseded; PRD.md needed updates to 20+ requirements and 20+ functional specifications; the beads-integration IG was renamed wholesale to task-system.md via `git mv` and fully rewritten. The remaining IGs (marketplace, plan-lifecycle, swarm-execution, chronicler, archivist, engineer, coder) each got targeted terminology sweeps -- `bd` commands became `yft_*` functions, `.beads/` paths became `.yoshiko-flow/`, "beads" became "tasks" or "entries" depending on context.

A verification pass after all agents completed caught one file the plan had missed: `IG/coder.md` still had eight "parent bead" references. Those were fixed inline. The final grep suite confirmed zero active beads-cli references remained -- only historical context in EDD design decision Source/Context fields, explaining what was removed and when. All 824 unit tests passed unchanged, confirming the changes were purely documentary.

## Decisions

- **Historical references preserved**: DD source/context fields in EDD/CORE.md still mention beads-cli, `.beads/`, and dolt -- because those fields document architectural history. Scrubbing them would lose the decision trail.
- **Strikethrough for removed TODOs**: TODO-006, TODO-009, and TODO-015 were marked with strikethrough rather than deleted, preserving the audit trail of what was once planned and why it became irrelevant.
- **TC renumbering**: When TC-003 (beads-cli dependency) was removed from the PRD, the remaining technical constraints were renumbered to close the gap rather than leaving a hole in the sequence.

## Next Steps

- [ ] No immediate follow-up -- specs are fully aligned with v3.0.0
- [ ] Future plans should reference the new terminology (tasks, entries, yft_* functions)
