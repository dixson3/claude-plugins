# Diary Entry: Plan 50 — Plugin Issue Reporting & Project Issue Tracking

**Date**: 2026-02-21 11:15
**Topics**: feature, planning, implementation
**Chronicle IDs**: yf-1zx, yf-bu2, yf-oro, yf-qji, yf-auc

## Summary

Implemented Plan 50 end-to-end in a single session, delivering two new capabilities to the yf plugin: `plugin` (issue reporting against the plugin repo) and `issue` (full project issue tracking lifecycle).

The plan addressed three open GitHub issues (#2, #16, #31) and followed a 6-phase implementation sequence: rename, foundation scripts, plugin reporting, project tracking, guards/hooks, and documentation.

The core of the implementation is a tracker abstraction layer (`tracker-detect.sh` + `tracker-api.sh`) that provides a uniform interface across GitHub, GitLab, and file-based backends. The issue capability mirrors the existing capture-then-process pattern (chronicle/archive) — issues are staged as `ys:issue` beads, then batch-processed through an agent-driven triage before submission.

## Decisions

- Merged the existing "Core" capability (just `setup`) into the new `plugin` prefix, renaming `/yf:setup` to `/yf:plugin_setup` across ~25 active files. Historical docs left as-is.
- Used bash 3.2-compatible parameter expansion (`${url%.git}`, `${url##*host:}`) instead of `sed -E` for URL slug parsing, after discovering macOS bash 3.2 doesn't support extended regex with sed.
- Added a dedicated `yf_issue_triage` agent for batch processing (mirrors `yf_chronicle_diary` pattern) rather than inline skill logic, because issue processing requires judgment on duplicates and cross-referencing.
- Implemented Rule 1.5 (hard enforcement) for issue disambiguation — plugin issues and project issues can never cross-route.
- Rule 5.6 (advisory) suggests `/yf:issue_capture` proactively but never suggests `/yf:plugin_issue` — plugin issue reporting is exclusively manually initiated.

## Deliverables

- 6 new skills: `plugin_issue`, `issue_capture`, `issue_process`, `issue_disable`, `issue_list`, `issue_plan`
- 1 new agent: `yf_issue_triage`
- 2 new scripts: `tracker-detect.sh`, `tracker-api.sh`
- 4 new config accessors in `yf-config.sh`
- 2 new rules (1.5 disambiguation, 5.6 issue worthiness)
- Pre-push advisory for staged `ys:issue` beads
- 22 new unit test cases across 3 test files
- Version bump: 2.25.0 → 2.26.0

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify tracker detection in a GitLab-hosted project
- [ ] End-to-end test: `/yf:issue_capture` → `/yf:issue_process` with real GitHub submission
- [ ] Address pre-existing test failure in swarm qualify (GitHub #32)
- [ ] Consider adding Linear/Jira backends in follow-up
